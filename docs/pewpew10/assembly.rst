Assembly
********

Unless you are participating in a workshop, the device comes unassembled. There
are three parts: the printed circuit board with the buttons and the
electronics, the display, and the battery holder. To assemble it you will need
a soldering iron, wire cutters, solder and two-sided tape. You will also need
two AAA 1.5V batteries, a micro-USB cable and a computer with a working USB
port.

Display
-------

You start the assembly by attaching and soldering the display. Insert the
provided LED matrix into the 16 holes in the middle of the printed circuit
board, making sure that the side of the matrix with text on it faces right,
towards the two fire buttons. You may need to straighten the pins a little if
they bent during the transport.

.. warning:: If you solder the display in the wrong orientation, it will not
    work correctly. Please make sure the orientation is correct before you
    start soldering.

Once the matrix is inserted, flip the device up-side-down, make sure that the
display aligns flush with the sides (there is a little wiggle room), and solder
each of the pins. To do that, touch the tip of a hot soldering iron to the pin
and the ring around the hole at the same time, wait a second for them to become
hot, and then touch them with the solder wire, melting enough solder to fill
the hole.

.. note:: If you are new to soldering, you can find soldering tutorials on the
    Internet.

Once all 16 pins of the matrix are soldered, use the wire cutters to cut them
flush with the circuit board.

Battery
-------

The next step is connecting and attaching the battery holder. First, make sure
that the wires of the battery holder go through the holes in the plastic that
are furthest apart. If they go through the holes that are close together, you
will need to move them back, and thread them through the correct holes. Once
you have done that, cut both wires to about 1cm length and remove the
insulation from them with the wire cutters (please don't use your teeth). Twist
the strands of each of the wire, so that they are easier to move through the
holes in the circuit board. Next, place two-sided tape on the battery holder,
and attach it to the circuit board so that the two wires go through the holes
marked + and - (make sure the red wire goes to +, and the black one to -).
There are two sets of such holes, pick the correct one depending on what order
the wires come out of your battery holder.

.. warning:: It is very important to pay attention to the battery polarity, as
    this device doesn't have any kind of reverse polarity protection, and
    coonnecting the batteries in reverse will damage it.

Flip the device to the top side, and use the soldering iron to solder the two
wires sticking out of the holes in the circuit board. Be careful to not touch
the plastic of the buttons with your iron, as it will melt. Finally, cut the
excess wires with your wire cutters. Your device is ready.

Insert two AAA 1.5V batteries into the battery holder, switch it on, and you
should see text "snake" scrolling on the display.

Welcome to PewPew Documentation
*******************************

PewPew is a family of handheld devices that make learning to write simple
games with Python easy, and also let you tinker with electronics.

They all have a small 8×8 display and six buttons, and they all use the same
"pew" library for accessing them. However, they differ in size, price and
features available.
